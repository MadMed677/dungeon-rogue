# Dungeon Rogue Game (the name may change in the future)

> **Note**
> The work is still in progress

## Description
Dungeon Rogue is a simple pet project that
helps me to understand the basic of game development.

During this pet project I'd like to learn:
### Map
- How to deal with `map`. How to render the map, how to add collisions to the map and some interactions with it
- How to create multiple levels


### Animations
- How to animate the player
- How to animate the enemies
- How to animate the player with multiple animations (when the player are walking, climbing) 

## Game Design Document
### Game design
The player has different maps with different game design.
1. Platformer. The user has side view camera and the usual platformer mechanics
   - Jumping
   - Fighting
   - Climbing to reach different map levels
   - Level progression (you may boost your level and it cause better armour, attack, etc)

2. Dungeon Crawler. User has top view camera and the usual dungeon crawler mechanics
   - Fighting
   - Crafting
   - Level progression (you may boost your level and it cause better armour, attack, etc)

### Technical requirements
The game should work as:
- `[required]` Native App
- `[required]` Web App
- Mobile App

### Documentation / Tests
All the code should be covered by documentation and tests and integrate it into
CI / CD pipeline.
